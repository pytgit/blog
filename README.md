# Learn, Data, Learn Blog

This blog is built based on Poole [Poole](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/1834359/71ae4048-73db-11e3-9a3c-df38eb170537.png), which is a static site generator, open sourced under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md), providing a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.

This blog is about Po-Yan's data science learnings.
