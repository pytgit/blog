This blog starts out as a way to record my adventures in learning data science, but it probably won't be confined to data science topics.

I have been a product manager in both large software enterprise and start up for the past 14 years. It's been a great rewarding experience, learning from really smart people, delivering software that millions of people use. However, during the course of my career, I also inadvertently get drawn to opportunities to write code even though I am not in a developer role. I also greatly enjoy digging into available product data to help make product decisions. As I see more software products making use of machine learning, I can't help but want to learn more about data science and machine learning.

After taking a couple of data science courses on Coursera, I decided to make the jump in 2019 and enroll in a data science bootcamp at Metis to dig deeper into data science. No matter what career path I decide to take afterwards,  this is going to be a ton of fun for me, and I will be blogging as I go. I hope you have fun reading about it too.
