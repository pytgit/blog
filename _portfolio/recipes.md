description: Mod-a-Recipe is developed as my capstone project at Metis data science immersive bootcamp, to combine my passions for cooking and natural language processing. The idea came from my own experience of always reviewing more than one recipe for a dish I had in mind to figure out what ingredients I can modify or swap out to suit my taste. Using natural language and machine learning techniques, similar recipes are found given a selected recipe, and suggestions on modifications are provided to make a recipe your own. <p>See <a href="https://github.com/pytgit/mod-a-recipe">here</a> for code on Github.<br>See <a href="./blog/mod-a-recipe">here</a> for blog post.<br>See <a href="https://mod-a-recipe.herokuapp.com/">here</a> for the web application.</p>
