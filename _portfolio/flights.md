image: img/portfolio/airplane-sm.png
description: Delayed aircraft are estimated to have cost the airlines several billion dollars in additional expense, not to mention the uncertainty it adds to a passenger's travels. The goals of this project as part of the Metis week 2 & 3 project is to  predict flight delay time using linear regression based on 2017 United States flights data. Through the analysis, it should also shine a light on factors that impact flight delay time, and help others to develop mitigating strategies.<p>See <a href="https://github.com/pytgit/flight_delay_lin_regression">here</a> for code on Github.<br>See <a href="./blog/flights_linear_regression">here</a> for blog post.</p>
